    <b>Tissues:</b> These datasets come from human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma resections, and they are all treatment naïve. Each patient is identified by an anonymized block ID (e.g. “C2_D1”). If a patient block had multiple regions profiled, this ID is followed by a region ID (e.g. “C3_D2_ROI1”). Finally, if a region had multiple sections profiled, this is indicated by a section ID (e.g. “C3_D12_ROI4_s2”).
